# Website Design Group Project

## Instructions to run the project locally

- Install PostgreSQL
- create a database called `testdb`. You can do so by using a postgres db manager or login into your postgreSQL service through terminal or CMD and running the command `CREATE DATABASE name`.
- make sure that the user name an password specified in the `db.config.js` file that is inside of the `anime-backend` folder matches those of your own database
- using `terminal or cmd` navigate inside of the `anime-backend` folder and type `node server.js` and press enter
- using `terminal or cmd` navigate inside of the `anime-list` folder and type `npm start` and press enter
- Play around with the project until you are satisfied. A admin user will be created for you on startup with `username: admin` and `password: 12345678`
